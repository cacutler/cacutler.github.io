            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hey, I'm Alex Cutler and I am a senior studying software engineering at Utah Tech University.  Some languages I have learned include Python, C, C++, C#, Assembly, JavaScript, Swift, Kotlin, HTML, CSS, MySQL, SQLite, and PHP.  I have also worked with various frameworks and libraries such as Vue.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Flask, Laravel, and Unity.  I am currently working on a project that involves creating a course tracker web application written in Angular and Firebase as well as a credit card clearinghouse project written in Python.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, reading books, and catching up on some of the latest news in technology and software.  Some video games I have been playing recently are Spider-Man: Miles Morales, the Sly Cooper series, and some Metroid games.  My current favorite book series are the Eragon series and the Michael Vey series.</p>
